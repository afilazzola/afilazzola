### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Alessandro Filazzola but most people just call me Alex. I'm a data scientist working at [ApexRMS](https://apexrms.com/), a firm dedicated to delivering state-of-the-art ecological models to decision makers. In my role there, I am developing a web application version of an ecological forecasting software (SyncroSim), using anonymized mobile cell data to gain insights into the use of urban green spaces, and developing an image classifier to quantify alpine snowpack using aerial imagery. I finished my PhD at York University where I examined how plants respond to climate in desert ecosystems. In my previous roles as a data scientist, I quantifying the financial consequences associated with lake ice loss from climate change, estimated the biodiversity impacts of domestic grazing, and explored the role of green infrastructure as a tool to support urban biodiversity. I have often run free workshops on efficient computing, collaborative coding, and clean code, many of which can be found in my Github repositories.
