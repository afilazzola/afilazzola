### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Alessandro Filazzola but most people just call me Alex. I'm a post-doctoral fellow working at the [Center for Urban Environments](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/cue/welcome) at the University of Toronto and I also moonlight as a post-doctoral fellow at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/).

I am an ecologist that is currently exploring how urban biodiversity is impacted by land development and climate change in a partnership with local conservation authorities. I am also a visiting post-doctoral researcher at York University where I examine global changes in lake chlorophyll in response to climate change and land use. I recently completed a Killam post-doctoral fellowship at University of Alberta examining the effects climate change and grazing on the trophic structure of ecological communities. I completed my PhD at York University examining mechanisms of plant-plant interactions in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. My other research includes exploring green infrastructure as a tool to mitigate the loss of biodiversity in cities and promoting R stats through workshops, publications, and open-source software.

- :notebook: Iâ€™m currently learning parallel computing and machine learning.
- :snowflake:  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything to do with extreme climate events on natural systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about replicability and reproducibility in science.
